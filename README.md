Script work on two mode. In first mode you have to specify sitemap of website ,it is fast.Just visit this URL http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ & make sitemap of victim website ;download text file of urllist.txt & put it in same directory of script.Now it crawl one by one url from urllist.txt & collect email address.
